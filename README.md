# Myntra Sales Data Analysis

Repository for the project hosted on Kaggle: [Myntra Sales Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/srushtipillare/myntra-sales-data-analysis)

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This data-analysis project explores sales data from the Indian fashion e-commerce platform **Myntra**. The aim is to extract insights about product categories, seasonality, pricing, and sales performance to drive business decisions.

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset contains information on Myntra sales including features such as product category, sub-category, sales units, pricing, year/quarter, etc.  
- Source: Kaggle project link above.  
- Pre-processing steps include cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, and deriving additional features (e.g., year, quarter) as needed.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- Jupyter/Colab Notebook  
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 🔍 Key Analysis Questions  
- Which product categories and sub-categories generate the highest sales?  
- How does seasonality (year, quarter) affect sales performance?  
- How does the average price vary across categories and what’s its effect on units sold?  
- Are there any correlations between pricing, discounting, and units sold?  
- What trends can we identify over the years?  

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights  
- Bar charts of top-selling categories and sub-categories  
- Trend plots showing sales over time (year/quarter)  
- Box/violin plots for pricing distribution by category  
- Heatmap showing correlation between features  
- Interactive dashboards (if any) for deeper exploration  

## 💡 Findings (Summary)  
- E.g., “Street-wear and casual wear categories consistently show higher units sold compared to premium formal wear.”  
- E.g., “Sales tend to spike in the final quarter of each year, indicating strong festive/holiday demand.”  
- E.g., “Lower average price doesn’t always lead to higher units sold — product category and brand play a big role.”
